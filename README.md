# GraceShopper-Remastered

## Description

GraceShopper-Remastered is an e-commerce web application inspired by the [original GraceShopper project](https://github.com/Mickey-d-s/GraceShopper). This remastered version allows users to place orders and view their order history, while providing admins with the ability to manage inventory.

As the lead developer, I coordinated a team of four to ensure the successful completion of the project. My responsibilities ranged from technical tasks to leadership roles, demonstrating my ability to deliver high-quality solutions.

Key achievements include:

- Developing a full-stack McDonaldâ€™s themed website with user registration, order creation, and checkout functionalities.
- Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, including role-based access control.
- Creating an admin dashboard for efficient inventory management and user permissions.
- Leading team meetings and facilitating communication to align with project timelines and goals.
- Conducting code reviews and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.

Technologies used: React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
